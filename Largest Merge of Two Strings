# why not word1[p1] or word2[p2]? this is to determine which char I have to choose when the char we are comparing are equal(if word1[p1]==word2[p2]) depending on the chars on the left e.g. if w1=adaa and w2= acaaaaa, I have to choose the a's of w1 since the left value of w1>w2 (daa> caaaaa or d>c).
